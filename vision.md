## Vision

To create a single, trusted, national AI Talent Hub that continuously identifies, develops, verifies, and connects Bangladeshi student talent to global opportunities.

This platform is not a job portal.
It is a **career intelligence and skill compounding system**.

## Long-Term Impact
- Reduce graduate unemployment
- Enable skill-based hiring
- Democratize access to AI careers
- Position Bangladesh as an AI talent powerhouse

## Core Belief
Talent is evenly distributed. Opportunity is not.
