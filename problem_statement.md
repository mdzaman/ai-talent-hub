## Problem Statement

Bangladesh has millions of students, but:
- No unified talent visibility
- Skill-to-job mismatch
- Resume-based hiring is broken
- Rural and female talent is underrepresented
- AI skills lack structured pathways

Existing platforms fail because they:
- Focus on content, not outcomes
- Use static resumes
- Lack explainable career guidance
- Do not scale inclusively

## Core Challenge
How do we identify and compound talent early, fairly, and continuously?
